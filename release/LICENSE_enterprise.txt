3.  Proprietary Rights. The Software, and any modifications or derivatives thereto, is and shall remain the sole property of Couchbase Inc. and its licensors, and, except for the license rights granted herein, Couchbase Inc. and its licensors retain all right, title and interest in and to the Software, including all intellectual property rights therein and thereto. The Software may include third party open source software components. If Licensee is the United States Government or any contractor thereof, all licenses granted hereunder are subject to the following: (a) for acquisition by or on behalf of civil agencies, as necessary to obtain protection as "commercial computer software" and related documentation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and as specified in Subpart 12.1212 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 C.F.R.12.1212, and its successors; and (b) for acquisition by or on behalf of the Department of Defense (DOD) and any agencies or units thereof, as necessary to obtain protection as "commercial computer software" and related documentation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and as specified in Subparts 227.7202-1 and 227.7202-3 of the DOD FAR Supplement, 48 C.F.R.227.7202-1 and 227.7202-3, and its successors.

4.  Support.   Couchbase Inc. offers several levels of Support Services for the Software (e.g., standard, and premium), each of which is described in detail on the Couchbase Inc. Website at www.Couchbase.com/products-and-services/Couchbase-support. Couchbase Inc. will provide Licensee with the level of Support Services selected by Licensee at the time of purchase in accordance with the Support Services fees and policies in effect on the Effective Date and available at the Couchbase Inc. Website. Licensee must have Licensed Servers at the same level of Support Services for all instances in a Production Deployment running the Software.  Licensee must also have Licensed Servers at the same level of Support Services for all instances in a development and test environment running the Software, although these Support Services may be at a different level than the production Licensed Servers. When using the Cross Data Center Replication feature, Licensee must have Licensed Servers at the same level of Support Services for all instances on all sides of the replication connection. As part of the Support Services, unless Licensee opts-out, Couchbase Inc. may have remote access to the Software that will enable it to receive data and information directly from the Software regarding Software bugs, errors, and other similar technical support issues. Couchbase Inc. will only use such data and information for the purposes of providing the Support Services and in aggregate form for the purposes of improving the Software. If Licensee elects to disable Couchbase Inc.'s remote access to the Software, Couchbase Inc. will not be responsible for any related delays in providing the Support Services.

5.  Fees.  Licensee will pay Couchbase Inc. the applicable recurring Subscription Fees for each Licensed Server on which a copy of the Software is deployed by Licensee. If this Agreement and the Subscription Term is renewed, for each annual year of the Subscription Term, Licensee shall pay the full renewal Subscription Fee for all deployed Licensed Servers. Annual fees will be due on each one (1) year anniversary of the Effective Date. Couchbase Inc. reserves the right to change the Subscription Fee for the next Renewal Term prior to the start date thereof.

6.  Payments.  All payments of fees or charges under this Agreement shall be made in US dollars and are due at the time of purchase. Late payments will bear interest at the lesser of one and one half percent (1 1/2%) per month or the maximum rate allowed by law. In addition, Licensee will reimburse Couchbase Inc. for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in collecting any overdue amounts.  All fees payable under this Agreement are net amounts and are payable in full, without deduction for taxes or duties of any kind. Subscription Fees are exclusive of, and Licensee is responsible for, all shipping costs, duties and taxes (including but not limited to Value Added Tax which shall be paid by Licensee, if applicable, at the rate and in the manner for the time being prescribed by law), excluding taxes based on Couchbase Inc.'s net income. All fees are non-refundable.
 
7.  Records Retention and Audit. Licensee shall maintain complete and accurate records to permit Couchbase Inc. to verify the number of Licensed Servers used by Licensee during the Subscription Term. Upon Couchbase Inc.'s written request, Licensee shall: (a) provide Couchbase Inc. with such records within ten (10) days; and (b) will furnish Couchbase Inc. with a certification signed by an officer of Licensee verifying that the Software is being used pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Upon at least thirty (30) days prior written notice, Couchbase Inc. may audit Licensee's use of the Software to ensure that Licensee is in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Any such audit will be conducted during regular business hours at Licensee's facilities and will not unreasonably interfere with Licensee's business activities. Licensee will provide Couchbase Inc. with access to the relevant Licensee records and facilities. If an audit reveals that Licensee has underpaid fees to Couchbase Inc. during the period audited, then Couchbase Inc. will invoice Licensee, and Licensee will promptly pay Couchbase Inc., for such underpaid fees based on Couchbase Inc.'s price list in effect at the time the audit is completed. If the underpaid fees exceed five percent (5%) of the Subscription Fee paid by Licensee for the Software, then Licensee will also pay Couchbase Inc.'s reasonable costs of conducting the audit.

8.  Confidentiality.  Licensee and Couchbase Inc. will maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information. The receiving party of any Confidential Information of the other party agrees not to use such Confidential Information for any purpose except as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. The receiving party shall protect the secrecy of and prevent disclosure and unauthorized use of the disclosing party's Confidential Information using the same degree of care that it takes to protect its own confidential information and in no event shall use less than reasonable care. The terms of this Confidentiality section shall survive termination of this Agreement. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, the receiving party will, at the disclosing party's option, promptly return or destroy (and provide written certification of such destruction) the disclosing party's Confidential Information. 

9.  Disclaimer of Warranty. THE SOFTWARE AND ANY SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. COUCHBASE INC. DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE OR THE SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER WILL MEET LICENSEE'S REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL OPERATE IN THE COMBINATIONS LICENSEE MAY SELECT FOR USE, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED OR THAT ALL SOFTWARE ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED.

10.3  Exclusions. Couchbase Inc. will have no liability for any infringement claim (a) based on modifications to the Software made by a party other than Couchbase Inc., if a claim would not have occurred but for such modifications, (b) based on the use of other than the then-current, unaltered version of the Software, unless the infringing portion is also in the then-current, unaltered release; (c) based on the use, operation or combination of the Software with non-Couchbase Inc. programs, data, equipment or documentation if such infringement would have been avoided but for such use, operation or combination; (d) attributable to any third party open source software components; or (e) based on Licensee's use of the Software other than in accordance with this Agreement or the applicable Documentation.

10.4  Sole Remedy. THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION CONSTITUTE THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF COUCHBASE INC., AND LICENSEE'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY THIRD PARTY CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY KIND.

11.  Subscription Term and Renewal; Termination. The initial Subscription Term shall begin on the Effective Date and will continue for a period of one (1) year. Thereafter, this Agreement (including any subscription licenses and Support Services) will automatically renew at Couchbase Inc.'s then-current fees for successive terms of one (1) year, unless either party gives written notice to the other of its intention not to renew at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of a term (the "Renewal Term").  Subject to Couchbase Inc.'s rights under Section 2 above, either party may terminate this Agreement prior to the end of a term if the other party materially breaches its obligations hereunder and, where such breach is curable, such breach remains uncured for thirty (30) days following written notice of the breach. Licensee's obligation to make a payment of any outstanding, unpaid fees shall survive termination of this Agreement. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Licensee will, at Couchbase Inc.'s option, promptly return or destroy (and provide written certification of such destruction) the applicable Software and all copies and portions thereof, in all forms and types of media. The following sections will survive termination or expiration of this Agreement: Sections 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14.

12.  Limitation of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL COUCHBASE INC. OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OR FOR THE COST OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR DOCUMENTATION OR THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY COUCHBASE INC. HEREUNDER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES OR OTHER LOSSES FOR LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF AND REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED. IN NO EVENT WILL COUCHBASE INC.'S OR ITS LICENSORS' AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO LICENSEE, FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND UNDER ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY, EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNTS PAID BY LICENSEE TO COUCHBASE INC. UNDER THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE ARISING OF A CLAIM. The parties expressly acknowledge and agree that Couchbase Inc. has set its prices and entered into this Agreement in reliance upon the limitations of liability specified herein, which allocate the risk between Couchbase Inc. and Licensee and form a basis of the bargain between the parties.
